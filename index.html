            <p>Leslie grew up in Dallas, TX surrounded by the arts. She attended Southern Methodist University originally as a music major in Voice and Cello but decided to switch to Cinema-Television and Psychology so she could begin focusing on another passion of hers: children’s media. </p>
            <p>In 2008, Leslie moved to New York City and began attending graduate school at New York University (NYU) in order to receive her Master’s in Children’s Media. While living in New York City, she got to study with children’s media industry leaders, intern and work at companies like <em>Sesame Street</em>, and even be a balloon handler in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Since her time at NYU, Leslie has been creating a children's television show targeted at 4 to 8-year-old children to help develop their music literacy, which she will begin pitching later this year.</p>
            <p>In her spare time, Leslie enjoys puppeteering her puppet, <a href="http://www.bleeckie.com" target="_blank">Bleeckie</a>, spending time with her husband, family, and friends, and walking her dog, Leia. She is beyond excited to learn more about coding through SMU's Coding Bootcamp so she can advance her career and further expand her creativity!</p>
